                Pupilbase introduces a revolutionary software package designed to cater to the specific needs of educational institutions. 
                Our mission is to make this innovative solution widely accessible to schools,
                and we believe in a distinctive approach to achieve this goal.
            </p>

            <p className=' mb-5'>
            Rather than resorting to costly advertising campaigns that could burden cash-strapped schools, we have devised an alternative strategy.
            </p>

            <p className=' mb-5'>
            When you refer Pupilbase to another educational institution, and they proceed to acquire our software, we express our gratitude by offering you a £50 token of appreciation. We encourage you to utilize this reward to enhance your personal well-being, perhaps by treating yourself and a loved one to a delightful meal at your local restaurant. The choice is entirely yours.
            </p>

            <p className=' mb-5'>
            We are committed to building our reputation and expanding our presence in the education sector through the endorsements of fellow professionals like you, all while reciprocating with a generous gesture. This approach allows us to allocate resources wisely, ensuring that schools are not burdened with unnecessary expenses stemming from elaborate advertising campaigns.
            </p>

            <p>
            If you are inclined to recommend Pupilbase to every educator within your network, we wholeheartedly support your initiative. For each school you refer that proceeds to purchase Pupilbase, we will extend our gratitude with a £50 token, and there are no limits to the number of schools you can recommend.
            </p>

            <p>
            We firmly believe that the more we can collectively spread the word about Pupilbase, the merrier the educational community will be. Join us in our mission to enhance the educational experience and empower schools with the tools they need.
